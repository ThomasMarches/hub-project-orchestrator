# Module Project Orchestrator

## Introduction

This project is designed to create a sophisticated module orchestrator capable of generating and deploying modular applications seamlessly. It simplifies the process of creating a module from a predefined template and deploying it to a specific target environment. Ideal for rapidly setting up applications combining front-end, back-end, and database technologies, along with custom configurations.

### Key Features

- **Template-Based Module Creation**: Facilitates module generation using predefined templates for various technologies.
- **Flexible Technology Stack**: Offers a range of front-end and back-end frameworks and database providers.
- **Custom Configuration**: Enables tailoring modules to specific requirements with customizable configurations.

### Technology Choices

The orchestrator will be developed in **Golang** or **Rust**, ensuring robust performance and reliability.

### Usable Frameworks

#### Front-End Potential Frameworks

- **Angular**: A platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for crafting natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

#### Back-End Potential Frameworks

- **Rust Actix**: A powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust.
- **Rust Rocket**: A web framework for Rust, focusing on ease-of-use, expressability, and speed.
- **Rust Axum**: A web application framework emphasizing ergonomics and modularity.
- **Go**: A statically typed, compiled language known for simplicity and efficiency.

#### Database Potential Providers

- **Postgres**: An open-source relational database, notable for its extensibility and SQL compliance.
- **Mongo**: A NoSQL database recognized for its scalability and flexibility.

#### Potential configurations

- **Git**: Availabality to create a git repository linked to the newly created project.
- **Continuous Integration**: Availability to setup CI pipelines related to the chosen technology stack.
